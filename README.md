# Insurance Policy Sales Data Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on the cleaning and analysis of a dataset containing insurance policy sales data since 2018. The objective is to generate a CSV report showcasing various metrics that illuminate the sales performance and trends of insurance policies.

## Features Analyzed
- **Monthly Policy Sales Figures**: The number of policies sold each month.
- **Cancellation Counts per Month**: The number of policies canceled each month.
- **New Policies Initiated Each Month**: The tally of new policies started monthly.
- **Month-over-Month Sales Growth Rates**: The percentage growth or decline in sales compared to the previous month.
- **Total Monthly Premium Collections**: The sum of premiums collected each month.
- **Monthly Insurance Premium Tax (IPT) Contributions**: The amount of IPT collected monthly.
- **SERL's Monthly Commission Earnings**: The commission earned by SERL each month, calculated excluding IPT.
- **Top-Performing Product for SERL**: Identification of the highest revenue-generating product for SERL on a monthly basis.

## Key Considerations
- The Insurance Premium Tax (IPT) impacts premium amounts in a manner akin to VAT.
- SERL's commissions are computed exclusive of IPT.

## Requirements
This analysis requires Python 3.x and the following libraries:
- Pandas
- Numpy
